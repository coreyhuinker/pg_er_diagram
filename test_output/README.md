# PostgreSQL E-R Diagram Geneator Test Output

This directory contains examples of output from a sample database [dvdrental](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/).   

The tooltips can be seen either by opening the SVG file directly in a browser, or via the `Raw` view option in github.

The .dot files are essentially debug-level output, allowing a user to tweak a generated graph to reorder, emphasize, or remove components.
